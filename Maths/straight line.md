# üìê Straight Lines ‚Äì Quick Notes (2D Geometry)

## ‚úÖ Line Fundamentals
### Core Equations:
1. **General Form**:  
   `ax + by + c = 0`  
2. **Slope-Intercept**:  
   `y = mx + c`  
   *(m = slope, c = y-intercept)*

### üì¶ Key Concepts
| Term       | Formula/Meaning               |
|------------|-------------------------------|
| **Slope (m)** | `(y‚ÇÇ - y‚ÇÅ)/(x‚ÇÇ - x‚ÇÅ)`       |
| **x-intercept** | Set `y=0`, solve for `x`    |
| **y-intercept** | Set `x=0`, solve for `y`    |

## ‚úèÔ∏è Line Equation Forms
| Form           | Equation                      | When to Use                 |
|----------------|-------------------------------|-----------------------------|
| **Point-Slope**  | `y - y‚ÇÅ = m(x - x‚ÇÅ)`        | Known point + slope         |
| **Two-Point**    | `(y-y‚ÇÅ)/(x-x‚ÇÅ) = (y‚ÇÇ-y‚ÇÅ)/(x‚ÇÇ-x‚ÇÅ)` | Two known points       |
| **Intercept**    | `x/a + y/b = 1`             | Known x & y intercepts      |

## üîç Important Relationships
1. **Parallel Lines**: Same slope (`m‚ÇÅ = m‚ÇÇ`)  
2. **Perpendicular Lines**:  
   `m‚ÇÅ √ó m‚ÇÇ = -1`  
   *(or slopes are negative reciprocals)*  
3. **Angle Between Lines**:  
   `tanŒ∏ = |(m‚ÇÅ - m‚ÇÇ)/(1 + m‚ÇÅm‚ÇÇ)|`

## üß† CS Applications
| Area            | Use Case                      |
|-----------------|-------------------------------|
| Computer Graphics | Line drawing (Bresenham's algorithm) |
| Game Development | Collision detection (hitboxes) |
| UI/UX Design    | Rendering buttons/div borders  |
| Data Visualization | Plotting trendlines          |

## üìä Worked Examples
### Example 1: Find slope  
Given points `A(2, 3)` and `B(5, 11)`:  
`m = (11 - 3)/(5 - 2) = 8/3`

### Example 2: Equation from two points  
Given `A(1, 2)` and `B(3, 6)`:  
1. Find slope: `m = (6-2)/(3-1) = 2`  
2. Use point-slope: `y - 2 = 2(x - 1)` ‚Üí `y = 2x`

## ‚úÖ Summary
1. **Slope (`m`)** defines steepness and direction.  
2. **Forms**: Choose based on given data (points/slopes/intercepts).  
3. **Applications**: Essential for graphics, games, and visual computing.
