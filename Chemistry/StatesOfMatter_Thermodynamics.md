# 🌡️ States of Matter & Thermodynamics (Detailed Notes)
## 📍 1. States of Matter
### 🔹 Classification
- Solid, liquid, gas – based on intermolecular forces & particle arrangement

- Properties: shape, volume, compressibility, density
### 🔹 Gas Laws
- Boyle’s Law (P ∝ 1/V at constant T)

- Charles’ Law (V ∝ T at constant P)
- Gay-Lussac’s Law (P ∝ T at constant V)
- Avogadro’s Law (V ∝ n)
- Combined gas equation: PV/T = constant
### 🔹 Ideal Gas Equation
- PV = nRT
- R: universal gas constant
- Standard Temperature and Pressure (STP)
### 🔹 Real Gases & Deviation
- Compressibility factor Z = PV/nRT

- Z=1 → ideal; Z≠1 → deviation

- Causes: finite molecular volume, intermolecular forces

- van der Waals equation: 

- 'a' corrects for attraction, 'b' for volume

### 🔹 Liquefaction & Critical Temperature

- Critical temperature: highest temperature at which a gas can be liquefied

- Critical pressure, critical volume

- Concept of condensation

### 🔹 Intermolecular Forces

- London dispersion forces

- Dipole-dipole interactions

- Hydrogen bonding

## 📍 2. Thermodynamics

### 🔹 Basic Concepts

- System & surroundings

- Types of systems: open, closed, isolated

- State functions (U, H, S, G) vs path functions (q, w)

### 🔹 First Law of Thermodynamics

- Energy conservation: ∆U = q + w

- Sign conventions: q > 0 (heat absorbed), w > 0 (work done on system)

### 🔹 Enthalpy (H)

- H = U + PV

- Useful at constant pressure

- ∆H: heat change at constant pressure

### 🔹 Internal Energy (U)

- Total energy (kinetic + potential) of system

### 🔹 Work

- Expansion work: w = –P∆V

### 🔹 Second Law of Thermodynamics

- Entropy (S): measure of disorder

- For spontaneous process: ∆S_universe > 0

- ∆G (Gibbs free energy): ∆G = ∆H – T∆S

- ∆G < 0 → spontaneous, ∆G > 0 → non-spontaneous

### 🔹 Heat Capacity & Calorimetry

- Heat capacity (C): q = C∆T

- Specific heat, molar heat capacity

### 🔹 Hess’s Law

- Total enthalpy change depends only on initial & final states

- Useful for calculating ∆H of reaction using steps
