# 🧪 Solutions & Colligative Properties (Detailed Notes)


## 📍 1. Types of Solutions

- True solutions: particle size < 1 nm, clear and stable

- Colloids: particle size 1–1000 nm, show Tyndall effect

- Suspensions: >1000 nm, settle on standing

- Types based on solvent & solute

- Solid in liquid, gas in liquid, liquid in liquid, etc.

- Saturated, unsaturated, supersaturated solutions
-----
## 📍 2. Concentration Units

- Molarity (M): moles of solute per liter of solution

- Molality (m): moles of solute per kg of solvent

- Mole fraction (X): moles of component / total moles

- Percentage composition: % w/w, % w/v

- Normality (N): equivalents per liter (used in acid-base)
-----
## 📍 3. Solubility

- Factors: temperature, pressure, nature of solute & solvent

- Henry’s law: solubility of gas ∝ partial pressure
-----
## 📍 4. Raoult’s Law

- For ideal solution: partial vapor pressure of component ∝ mole fraction

- Total vapor pressure: sum of partial pressures

- Deviation: positive (P↑) or negative (P↓) due to non-ideal interactions
-----
## 📍 5. Colligative Properties

- Depend only on number of solute particles, not nature

### 🔹 Relative lowering of vapor pressure

- ∆P/P° = X_solute

### 🔹 Elevation of boiling point

- ∆Tb = Kb × m

- Kb: ebullioscopic constant

### 🔹 Depression of freezing point

- ∆Tf = Kf × m

- Kf: cryoscopic constant

### 🔹 Osmotic pressure (π)

- π = C × R × T (C = molarity)

- Used to find molar mass of solute

## 📍 6. Abnormal Molar Masses & van’t Hoff Factor

- Association / dissociation changes number of particles

- van’t Hoff factor (i): actual number of particles / expected

- Modified formulas: ∆Tb = i·Kb·m, etc.
