# 📡 Communication Systems – Quick Notes
## ✅ What is communication?
- Process of transmitting information (signal) from a source to a destination over a channel.

- Example: You speaking (source) → air (channel) → friend’s ear (destination).

## 🛠 Basic components
| Block              | What it does                                    |
| ------------------ | ----------------------------------------------- |
| Information source | Generates message / data                        |
| Transmitter        | Converts message into signal (e.g., modulation) |
| Channel            | Medium carrying signal (wire, fiber, air)       |
| Noise              | Undesired signal interfering with message       |
| Receiver           | Extracts original message                       |
| Destination        | Where message is delivered                      |

## 🔄 Types of signals
| Type    | Meaning                          |
| ------- | -------------------------------- |
| Analog  | Continuous (voice, video)        |
| Digital | Discrete 0/1 (used in computers) |

## 📦 Modulation
- Process of varying a carrier signal (high freq.) based on message signal.

| Type                      | Used for       |
| ------------------------- | -------------- |
| AM (Amplitude Modulation) | Vary amplitude |
| FM (Frequency Modulation) | Vary frequency |
| PM (Phase Modulation)     | Vary phase     |


- ✅ In computers/networks → Digital modulation (ASK, FSK, PSK, QAM).

## 🧩 Bandwidth
- Range of frequencies a signal occupies.

- Higher bandwidth → can transmit more data.

- Measured in Hz.

## 📶 Noise
- Unwanted disturbance that affects signal.

- Always present.

- In networks → “packet loss”, “bit error rate”.

## 🌐 Propagation medium (channel)
| Type     | Examples                      |
| -------- | ----------------------------- |
| Wired    | Copper cables, optical fiber  |
| Wireless | Air (Wi-Fi, radio, satellite) |


## 🏗 Types of communication systems
| Type           | Example                                   |
| -------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| Point-to-point | Walkie-talkie, wired phone                |
| Broadcast      | TV, radio                                 |
| Duplex         | Mobile phone (talk & listen at same time) |


## 🔌 Multiplexing
| Type                                  | What it does           |
| ------------------------------------- | ---------------------- |
| TDM (Time Division Multiplexing)      | Divide time slots      |
| FDM (Frequency Division Multiplexing) | Divide frequency bands |


## 🔑 Important terms to remember
| Term          | Meaning                                                     |
| ------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| Transducer    | Converts one form of energy to another (e.g., mic, speaker) |
| Attenuation   | Signal strength loss over distance                          |
| Amplification | Boosts signal power                                         |
| Repeaters     | Devices that regenerate signal in networks                  |


## ⚡ Formulas (just basics)
| Concept        | Formula               |
| -------------- | --------------------- |
| Bandwidth (BW) | BW = f\_high – f\_low |
| Data rate      | Data rate ∝ Bandwidth |


## ✅ Summary
- Communication system moves data from source to destination.

- Core blocks: source → transmitter → channel → receiver → destination.

- Bandwidth, modulation, noise & multiplexing define system performance.

- Digital comm. is foundation of computer networks & internet.
