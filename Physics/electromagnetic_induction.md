# 🔄 Physics Notes – Chapter 11: Electromagnetic Induction & AC



## 📍 Faraday's Laws of Electromagnetic Induction
1. **First Law:**  
   An EMF (ε) is induced when magnetic flux through a circuit changes  
2. **Second Law:**  
   `ε = -dΦ/dt`  
   Where:  
   - Φ = BAcosθ (magnetic flux)  
   - Negative sign → Lenz's Law

## 📍 Lenz's Law
- Induced current flows to **oppose** the change producing it  
- Explains the negative sign in Faraday's law  
- Conservation of energy consequence

## 📍 Self & Mutual Induction
| Type           | Equation              | Description                     |
|----------------|-----------------------|---------------------------------|
| **Self**       | `ε = -L(dI/dt)`       | EMF induced in same coil        |
| **Mutual**     | `ε₂ = -M(dI₁/dt)`     | EMF induced in nearby coil      |

**Units:**  
- L (Self-inductance): Henry (H)  
- M (Mutual inductance): Henry (H)

## 📍 Eddy Currents
- Circulating currents in conductors  
- **Applications:**  
  - Induction furnaces  
  - Electromagnetic braking  
  - Metal detectors

## 📍 Alternating Current (AC)
**Waveform:**  
`I(t) = I₀ sin(ωt)`  
`V(t) = V₀ sin(ωt)`  

Where:  
- I₀/V₀ = Peak current/voltage  
- ω = 2πf (angular frequency)

## 📍 RMS & Average Values
| Value Type | Current          | Voltage          |
|------------|------------------|------------------|
| **RMS**    | Iᵣₘₛ = I₀/√2     | Vᵣₘₛ = V₀/√2     |
| **Average**| Iₐᵥ = 2I₀/π      | Vₐᵥ = 2V₀/π      |

## 📍 LC & LCR Circuits
**LC Circuit:**  
- Energy oscillates between:  
  - Electric (capacitor)  
  - Magnetic (inductor)  

**LCR Circuit:**  
- Added resistance causes damping  
- Resonance at ω₀ = 1/√(LC)

## 📝 Useful Diagrams to Sketch:
1. Changing flux through a coil  
2. AC waveform showing:  
   - Peak values (I₀, V₀)  
   - RMS values  
3. LC circuit energy exchange  
4. LCR circuit at resonance
