# ⚡ Physics Notes – Chapter 8: Electrostatics

## 📍 Electric Charge
- **Fundamental property:**  
  - Like charges repel (+ + / - -)  
  - Unlike attract (+ -)  
- **Quantization:** `q = ±ne` (e = 1.6×10⁻¹⁹ C)  
- **Conservation:** Total charge always conserved  

---

## 📍 Coulomb's Law
`F = k(q₁q₂)/r²`  
Where:  
- `k = 1/(4πε₀) ≈ 9×10⁹ N·m²/C²`  
- ε₀ = 8.85×10⁻¹² C²/N·m² (permittivity)  

**Force direction:** Along line joining charges  

---

## 📍 Electric Field (E)
`E = F/q₀` (q₀ = test charge)  
- **Unit:** N/C or V/m  
- **Direction:**  
  - Away from +Q  
  - Toward -Q  

**Field due to point charge:**  
`E = kQ/r²`  

---

## 📍 Electric Field Lines
- **Properties:**  
  - Start +ve, end -ve  
  - Never intersect  
  - Density ∝ field strength  
- **Important patterns:**  
  - Isolated point charge  
  - Dipole  
  - Parallel plates  

---

## 📍 Electric Potential (V)
`V = U/q = kQ/r`  
- **Unit:** Volt (V)  
- **Relation to E-field:**  
  `E = -dV/dr` (negative gradient)  

---

## 📍 Equipotential Surfaces
- **Properties:**  
  - V = constant everywhere  
  - ⊥ to field lines  
  - No work done moving charge along them  

---

## 📍 Gauss's Law
`∮E·dA = Q_enclosed/ε₀`  
**Best for:**  
- Infinite planes  
- Spherical shells  
- Long cylinders  

---

## 📍 Capacitance
| Concept | Formula | Notes |
|---------|---------|-------|
| Definition | `C = Q/V` | Farad (F) |
| Parallel plates | `C = ε₀A/d` | A = plate area |
| Energy stored | `U = ½CV² = ½QV = Q²/2C` | 3 equivalent forms |
