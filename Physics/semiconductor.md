# 📘 Semiconductor Electronics – Quick Notes
- ✅ What is a semiconductor?
    - Material with electrical conductivity between conductors (e.g., copper) & insulators (e.g., rubber).

    - Resistivity: ≈ 10^-5 to 10^6 ohm-m.

    - Common examples: Silicon (Si), Germanium (Ge).

## 🧪 Types of semiconductors
| Type      | What it means                                | Example        |
| --------- | -------------------------------------------- | -------------- |
| Intrinsic | Pure semiconductor                           | Pure Si, Ge    |
| Extrinsic | Doped with impurity to increase conductivity | N-type, P-type |
## 🧩 Doping
- Adding small amounts of impurities to change conductivity.

| Type   | Dopant                    | Majority carriers | Minority carriers |
| ------ | ------------------------- | ----------------- | ----------------- |
| N-type | Pentavalent (e.g., P, As) | Electrons         | Holes             |
| P-type | Trivalent (e.g., B, Al)   | Holes             | Electrons         |

## ⚡ Charge carriers
- Free electrons (negative charge)

- Holes (missing electron, acts like +ve charge)

## 🔌 PN junction
- Formed by joining P-type and N-type semiconductors.

- Depletion region: Area near junction where mobile charge carriers are absent.

- Barrier potential: Small voltage across depletion region (≈ 0.3 V for Ge, 0.7 V for Si).

## 🌊 Biasing a PN junction
| Type         | What happens                                                        |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Forward bias | P connected to +, N to – → depletion region narrows → current flows |
| Reverse bias | P to –, N to + → depletion widens → very little current             |

## 🛠 Applications of PN junction
- Diodes (rectifiers, clippers, clampers)

- LEDs, photodiodes, solar cells

- Transistors

## 🔄 Transistors (BJT basics)
- Three layers: Emitter, Base, Collector.

- Two types: NPN & PNP.

- Used for amplification and switching.

## 🏗 Basic ICs & digital logic
- Semiconductors → used to build:

    - Logic gates (AND, OR, NOT, NAND, NOR, XOR, XNOR)

    - Flip-flops, counters, multiplexers

- Foundation of Digital Electronics


## ⚡ Key formulas / concepts to remember
| Concept           | Formula / note                                             |
| ----------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| Conductivity (σ)  | σ = nqμ (n: carrier concentration, q: charge, μ: mobility) |
| Barrier potential | ≈ 0.3 V (Ge), 0.7 V (Si)                                   |
| Depletion region  | Region without free charge carriers                        |

## ✅ Summary
- Semiconductors are the building blocks of modern computers.

- Doping → N-type & P-type → PN junction → diodes, transistors → ICs → processors & memory.

- Directly used in semiconductor physics, digital electronics, computer architecture.
