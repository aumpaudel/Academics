# ⚡ Physics Notes – Chapter 2: Newton's Laws of Motion

## 📍 Dynamics Fundamentals
**Definition:** Study of motion and its causes  
**Key Concept:** Forces alter an object's state of motion

## ✅ Newton's Three Laws

### 🧩 First Law (Inertia)
`An object maintains its state of motion unless acted upon by a net force`  
- **Inertia:** Resistance to change in motion  
- **Examples:**  
  - Sudden brake → passenger lurches forward  
  - Spacecraft in vacuum continues moving  

### 🧩 Second Law (F=ma)
`ΣF = ma`  
- **Key Points:**  
  - Acceleration ∝ Net Force  
  - Acceleration ∝ 1/mass  
- **Unit:** 1 Newton (N) = 1 kg·m/s²  

### 🧩 Third Law (Action-Reaction)
`For every action, there's an equal/opposite reaction`  
- **Features:**  
  - Forces act on different objects  
  - Never cancel each other  
- **Examples:**  
  - Rocket propulsion  
  - Walking friction

## ✏️ Momentum & Impulse
| Concept | Formula | Unit | Significance |
|---------|---------|------|--------------|
| Momentum (p) | `p = mv` | kg·m/s | "Quantity of motion" |
| Impulse (J) | `J = FΔt = Δp` | N·s | Change in momentum |

---

## 📍 Conservation of Momentum
`m₁u₁ + m₂u₂ = m₁v₁ + m₂v₂` (Closed system)  
**Applications:**  
- Elastic/inelastic collisions  
- Rocket equations  
- Recoil effects  

---

## 📍 Friction
| Type | Formula | Characteristics |
|------|---------|-----------------|
| Static (fₛ) | `fₛ ≤ μₛN` | Prevents motion |
| Kinetic (fₖ) | `fₖ = μₖN` | Opposes sliding |
| Rolling | `fᵣ ≈ μᵣN` | Least resistance |

**Note:** μₛ > μₖ (generally)

---

## 🧲 Circular Motion Basics
`F_c = mv²/r = mω²r`  
- **Direction:** Always toward center  
- **Examples:**  
  - Car turning (friction provides Fₖ)  
  - Planetary orbits (gravity provides Fₖ)

## 📝 Essential Diagrams:
1. **Free-body diagrams:**  
   - Block on incline (show W, N, f, Fₙₑₜ)  
   - Atwood machine  
2. **Action-reaction pairs:**  
   - Book on table  
   - Foot kicking ball  
3. **Circular motion:**  
   - Velocity (tangential)  
   - Centripetal force (radial)
