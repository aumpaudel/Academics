# 🌍 Physics Notes – Chapter 5: Gravitation

## 📍 Newton's Law of Universal Gravitation
`F = G(m₁m₂)/r²`  
- **G** = 6.67×10⁻¹¹ N·m²/kg²  
- Acts along line joining centers  
- Valid for point masses/spherically symmetric objects

## 📍 Gravitational Field & Potential
| Concept | Formula | Unit |
|---------|---------|------|
| Field (g) | `g = F/m = GM/r²` | N/kg or m/s² |
| Potential (V) | `V = -GM/r` | J/kg |

---

## 📍 Acceleration Due to Gravity
**Earth's Surface:**  
`g = GM/R² ≈ 9.8 m/s²`  
Where:  
- M = 5.97×10²⁴ kg (Earth's mass)  
- R = 6.4×10⁶ m (Earth's radius)  

**Variations:**  
| Condition | Formula |
|-----------|---------|
| At height h | `gₕ = g[R/(R+h)]²` |
| At depth d | `g_d = g(1 - d/R)` |

---

## 📍 Satellite Motion
| Quantity | Formula | Notes |
|----------|---------|-------|
| Orbital velocity | `v₀ = √(GM/r)` | Circular orbit |
| Time period | `T = 2π√(r³/GM)` | Kepler's 3rd Law |
| Escape velocity | `vₑ = √(2GM/R)` | ≈11.2 km/s (Earth) |

## 📍 Gravitational Potential Energy
`U = -GMm/r`  
- **Negative** → binding energy  
- Zero reference at infinity  

---

## 📍 Kepler's Laws
1. **Elliptical Orbits:** Planets move in ellipses with Sun at one focus  
2. **Equal Areas:** Radius vector sweeps equal areas in equal times  
3. **Period Law:** `T² ∝ r³` for circular orbits

## 📝 Essential Diagrams:
1. Satellite in orbit showing:
   - Gravitational force vector
   - Velocity vector (⊥ to force)
2. Graphs:
   - g vs altitude
   - g vs depth
3. Elliptical orbit with:
   - Foci positions
   - Semi-major/minor axes
